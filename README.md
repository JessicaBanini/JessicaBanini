# Hi there, I’m Torgbenu-Banini Jessica Emefa 👋

I'm a self-taught Frontend Developer and public speaker from Ghana with a deep passion for using tech to solve real-world problems

I love building clean, user-focused web interfaces with **React**, and I’m currently exploring the intersection between **AI, web development**, and **public impact**. 
From NFT e-commerce platforms to AI-powered job assistants, I’m always experimenting with ideas that can create value.

🎤 Beyond code, I enjoy speaking to young people about personal branding, breaking into tech, and overcoming limitations.
I believe your voice and your story are powerful tools and I use mine to inspire.

💡 Some of my interests:
- Creating digital products that make life easier
- Tech for Agriculture (AgriTech)
- Building personal tools with AI & automation
- Public speaking + youth empowerment
